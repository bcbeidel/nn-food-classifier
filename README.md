nn-food-classifier
==============================

Multi-class classification model implementation on [tensorflow: food-101](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101) data set.

The purpose of this project is to refresh my python skills and experiment with multiple deep-learning implementations including:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) (i.e., from scratch)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Tensorsflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

Learning Objectives
------------

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated to myself that I am able to:

- Use python to prepare an image data set for model training
- Leverage visualization libraries in python to 
- Leverage AWS S3 to store bulk, raw and intermediate data
- Build A Deep Neural Network in a number of frameworks for comparison including numpy, tensorflow, keras, and pytorch
